<h1> Password-encryption-in-python </h1>
A little python programm to encrypt passwords for the purpose of storing them in Databases.
<br>
<h3> Why do i do this? </h3>
In this project im trying to create password encryption, functions to check for the password and Databases to store them to take a closer practical look of how i can store passwords in future projects securly.
Im am focusing on the right choice of encrypion, the understading of how it works and the correct usage of DB queries to prevent SQL Injections.

<h3> What can the program do? </h3>
<ul>
    <li> It contains a simple cli login/register program</li>
    <li> It has Sqlite DB intergration to store password, username and creation date</li>
    <li> It ecnrypts passwords using Argon2 to store them in the DB </li>
    <li> The login feature checks if the user exists in the DB and if the password in the DB macthes the given password </li>
</ul>
<br>
Its a simple program to understand how simple password hashing work in python and to be able to reuse the concept in other projects like websites.
Also it gives me first insights into the world of secure coding, how password management works and why its important to encrypt password in projects. It helps me understandthe fundamentals of secure coding. This is important to my (hopefully) future as a CybeSecuritist.
Maybe it also helps people who just started to understand the fundamentals, just like it helped me!
